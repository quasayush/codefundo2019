Use of Azure Blockchain to make elections secure and reliable

Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain

Overview

The main idea of this project is to give a shape to the revolutionary idea of online voting by creating a secure online channel for casting votes. This idea can also be extended so as to provide provision for advance voting for military personnel and people going outside country. Very less voter turnout is generally caused due to a lot of people not present in their respective constituency and this involves students and people with jobs that involves. Online voting using Blockchain technology is the answer to the above problem discussed. 


The Idea

The idea is to build a secure web-based application where data of each constituency would be shown such as list of candidates with their respective manifesto as well as the available bio-data of the particular candidate. A sub-admin and master- admin panel would be provided for the platform to edit the data and progress in the constituency and manage the data of whole platform respectively. The web platform would be secured by reliable API authentication so that no tampering could be made.
The online web platform would also contain the provision of casting vote but it will be open at selected centres only at the time of voting. Suppose a person casts vote from a place other than that of his constituency, but with linking aadahar with voter-id card and getting fingerprint authentication his vote would be added to the Blockchain of his/her constituency only. Same would be the case with advance voting. Now since vote are stored as Blockchain, tampering would not be possible because each block will contain a hash and a hash of previous vote casted. Tampering with a vote will cause the hash to be changed and then previous hash of next block will not match. Also with proof-of work concept and whole copy of Blockchain scattered on the network it makes online voting secure. An algorithm can be developed to count the votes instantly as soon as the voting is completed.
